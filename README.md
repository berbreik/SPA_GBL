SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION

Starting with frontend folder contains the html css and javascript file for the creation of table and sidebars.sidebar menu is dynamic as it high lights the elemetn overwhich we ohover and its responsive too.boopstracp could have improved it futher,Although its still incomplete.

schema.js contains the schema of the project as we can mutate and fetch the data but the data are stored in variables rathar than data base but still by running quaries you can fetch the exact feild you are looking for with the help of garphql thats an advantage of graphql over restapi , rstapi returns the whole  feild rather than an specific one.
with the help of mutation we can post the data  there are some costume varibles like stack where we can store specific priority between high mid and low.Although i couldnt connected the database with graphql  and frontend with graphql.this repo still needs some more work.
